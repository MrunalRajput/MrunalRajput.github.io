  			Having started my career eight years ago as a System Engineer with Infosys, the mixed feeling of thrill, joy and content achieved by a successful release still remains the same. Starting off as a software developer, I have an extensive experience with design, development, testing, release and change management. As I worked across diverse domains like telecommunications and financial services, I realised the need for understanding and utilising data to it's fullest. That's when I decided to pursue Masters in Information Systems.<br>
  			It's important that the product is designed considering the customer demands and firm's IT strategy. Also, it's equally important to convey the product's true potential to the end user.
